# Installation
Have Python 3.8.8 or greater, **AND** VLC Media Player and install either the .py file, or the .exe. Don't try sending the exe over Discord, they'll turn your message into a link to a food recipe.

# How to add custom videos

Custom videos can only be added if you use the .py file. The exe is used for you to just easily install it, without any of the folders bothering you.
To start, download your video. It must be a .mp4 file. After it's downloaded, put the file in the folder with the .py file, then go in the Python file, and put your video file name where the other names are. Once finished, boot the app again and it should work.
